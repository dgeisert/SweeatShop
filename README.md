This Unity 2019.2.1f1 project is a base from which I plan to make my game jam games.  I welcome anyone else to use it as well.  I do this so that all the parts of the games I make are from me or the team members I work with, and the basic setup of menus, git ignores, projects settings, etc. are not time sinks.

Included:
* Preloader scene
* Main menu
* Controls explanation screen
* Scene flows
* Scoring system
* Score screen
* Pause screen
